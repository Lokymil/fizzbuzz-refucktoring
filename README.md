# FizzBuzz refucktoring

The point of this project is to provide FizzBuzz implementation to be destroyed.

## What to do ?

Current implementation quite clean. There is still room for improvement but let's start with this.  
You goal is to change implementation as much as you can to make it unreadable, obfuscated and create a maintenance nightmare. Your only restriction is not to break any tests.

## JS Playground

### Install

Be sure to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Then you can install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# -- OR --
yarn
```

### Run test

Run test in one shot :

```sh
npm run test
# -- OR --
yarn test
```

Run test in watch mode:

```sh
npm run test -- --watch
# -- OR --
yarn test --watch
```

### What to refucktor ?

Now that your tests are running green, you can destroy `./index.js` content.

Make your worst !
